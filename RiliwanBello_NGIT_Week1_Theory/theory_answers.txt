    - Software (Instructions): Windows, Chrome, VS Code.

2. Operating System (OS): Software that manages computer hardware and software resources. Functions: Managing files/memory and providing a user interface.

3.Windows vs. Linux: * Windows is closed-source; Linux is open-source.
    - Windows uses letters for drives (C:); Linux uses a root tree structure (/).
    - Windows is paid/licensed; Linux is mostly free.

4. Terms:
    - File: A resource for storing information.
    - Folder: A container used to organize files.
    - File Extension: The suffix at the end of a file (e.g., .txt) that tells the OS how to open it.

5. Command Line: A text-based interface used to run programs and manage files. It is important for developers because it is faster for automation and server management.

6. Internet Terms:
    - Server: A computer that provides data to other computers.
    - Browser: Software used to access the web (e.g., Chrome).
    - IP Address: A unique string of numbers identifying a device on a network.
    - DNS: The "phonebook" of the internet that turns names (google.com) into IP addresses.
    - HTTP vs. HTTPS: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP; it encrypts data for safety.

7. Client-Server Model: A user (Client) requests a website via a browser, and a remote computer (Server) sends the website data back. Example: Searching for a video on YouTube.


8. Frontend vs. Backend: Frontend is what the user sees and interacts with (HTML/CSS). Backend is the "behind the scenes" logic and database management.

9. Website, Domain, & Hosting: The Website is the content; the Domain is the address (name); Hosting is the physical space (server) where the files live.

10.Browser Rendering: The browser receives HTML/CSS/JS code, parses it, and creates a visual "render tree" to display the website on your screen.
