  - Understanding the fundamentals of computers and operating systems is the foundation of any successful web development career.
    Since web applications run on servers (which are just specialized computers) and are accessed via various operating systems, 
    knowing how they manage memory and files is crucial. It allows a developer to troubleshoot issues that aren't just related to code, 
    such as path errors or permission bugs. Furthermore, understanding the "how" behind the internet—like DNS and the client-server model—helps
    in building faster and more secure applications. Without these basics, a developer is simply writing code without knowing the environment it lives in. Mastering these building blocks ensures a smoother transition into more complex coding tasks.
